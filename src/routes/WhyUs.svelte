                You can hire us by man-hour, or lump-sump project based. We only outsource the UI/UX and Graphics Design when necessary (and it would be transparent), all other development and architecture all will be fully done by our internal team (we are so proud on our own code quality, so we won't trust it to other party). We also provide training for your own team for further internal development.
